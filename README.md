# Plant Classification
Deep Learning classification model for plant recognition.
## üì£ About
This project was an integral part of the master's degree course "Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning" at Politecnico di Milano. It consists in the implementation of a model for the classification of different plant species, trained over a given dataset and then evaluated using a secret test set.

This repo contains both the code used to generate the model and the 3-page report describing the development process.
